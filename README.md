# Python-Invaders

Author: Timothy Eng

Created: November 2017, Completed: Janurary 2018

Current Version: 1.2

Description: An implementation of the classic game Space Invaders in Python, with a Star Wars theme. Completed in the end of 2017 as the final project for Cornell's Introductory Python class. We were given the game module core code but had to implement the rest ourselves. All graphics, sound effects, concepts, etc. were created/designed by me.

Models module for Alien Invaders

This module contains the model classes for the Alien Invaders game. Anything that you
interact with on the screen is model: the ship, the laser bolts, and the aliens.

Just because something is a model does not mean there has to be a special class for
it.  Unless you need something special for your extra gameplay features, Ship and Aliens
could just be an instance of GImage that you move across the screen. You only need a new 
class when you add extra features to an object. So technically Bolt, which has a velocity, 
is really the only model that needs to have its own class.

With that said, we have included the subclasses for Ship and Aliens.  That is because
there are a lot of constants in consts.py for initializing the objects, and you might
want to add a custom initializer.  With that said, feel free to keep the pass underneath 
the class definitions if you do not want to do that.

You are free to add even more models to this module.  You may wish to do this when you 
add new features to your game, such as power-ups.  If you are unsure about whether to 
make a new class or not, please ask on Piazza.

# PRIMARY RULE: Models are not allowed to access anything in any module other than

# calls the method.


class Ship(GImage):
    """
    A class to represent the game ship.
    
    At the very least, you want a __init__ method to initialize the ships dimensions.
    These dimensions are all specified in consts.py.
    
    You should probably add a method for moving the ship.  While moving a ship just means
    changing the x attribute (which you can do directly), you want to prevent the player
    from moving the ship offscreen.  This is an ideal thing to do in a method.
    
    You also MIGHT want to add code to detect a collision with a bolt. We do not require
    this.  You could put this method in Wave if you wanted to.  But the advantage of 
    putting it here is that Ships and Aliens collide with different bolts.  Ships 
    collide with Alien bolts, not Ship bolts.  And Aliens collide with Ship bolts, not 
    Alien bolts. An easy way to keep this straight is for this class to have its own 
    collision method.
    
    However, there is no need for any more attributes other than those inherited by
    GImage. You would only add attributes if you needed them for extra gameplay
    features (like animation). If you add attributes, list them below.

    A class representing a laser bolt.
    
    Laser bolts are often just thin, white rectangles.  The size of the bolt is 
    determined by constants in consts.py. We MUST subclass GRectangle, because we
    need to add an extra attribute for the velocity of the bolt.
    
    The class Wave will need to look at these attributes, so you will need getters for 
    them.  However, it is possible to write this assignment with no setters for the 
    velocities.  That is because the velocity is fixed and cannot change once the bolt
    is fired.
    
    In addition to the getters, you need to write the __init__ method to set the starting
    velocity. This __init__ method will need to call the __init__ from GRectangle as a 
    helper.
    
    You also MIGHT want to create a method to move the bolt.  You move the bolt by adding
    the velocity to the y-position.  However, the getter allows Wave to do this on its
    own, so this method is not required.
